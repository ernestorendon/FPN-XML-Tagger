# FPN - XML Tagger

This small Python script sanitizes input .XML files, adding and removing information that is necessary for proper processing and uploading of these public notice files into FloridaPublicNotices.com

Currently, it generates a new folder containing new and separate files that contain only the PDF layout file; but sometimes a system can use a single file to upload individual notices AND the PDF file.
