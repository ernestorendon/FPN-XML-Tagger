# Program compares filenames located in directories/subdirs against list of potential matches.
# If a match is found, then the match is duplicated and manipulated into a new file.
# This new dupe file is properly named, has its username/password fields removed, and is placed in the same dir as the original match.

# At the same time, another XML file is generated in a new dir on the root of the user-provided folder.
# This other XML file (solo layout file) has the same proper name as before, but only contains the single layout object 
# They need to be separated in order to have the same exact name and avoid duplicate name error
